0) Install opencv
		https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/windows_install/windows_install.html
		
1) Modify PATH variable of the system to include 
	OPENCV_DIR/bin
	
2) Visual Studio configuration:
	C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories
	Add the directories with libraries: OPENCV_DIR/build/include
	
	Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories
	Add the directories with libraries: OPENCV_DIR/build/x64/vcXX/lib  (XX version of Visual: 15, 17...)
	
	Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies
	If Release mode write:
		opencv_core2413.lib , opencv_imgproc2413.lib, opencv_highgui2413.lib
	If Debug mode write:
		opencv_core2413d.lib , opencv_imgproc2413d.lib, opencv_highgui2413d.lib
		
	Configuration Properties -> VC++ Directories -> Include Directories
	Add OPENCV_DIR/build/include where OPENCV_DIR is the folder of unpacked OpenCV
	
3) Visual Studio parameters (2 parameters, in image and out image) IN IMAGE MUST BE AN EXR
	PX -> Properties -> Configuration Properties -> Debugging -> Command Arguments
	Add in and out image (example: ennis_latlong.exr OUTPUT.png)
	(In image must be inside P5 folder)
	
	
4) Open P5.sln to open the Visual Studio solution

5) According to Additional Dependencies (step 2) run Visual Studio in Debug mode or Release mode,
and execute (ctrl+F5)

6) Result image should appear alonside In image (inside P5 folder)
